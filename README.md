# 🧪 Cybersecurity Home Lab for SOC Analyst Training

## 🧩 Overview
This is my personal cybersecurity home lab designed to help me learn and demonstrate **SOC analyst** skills.  
It simulates a small enterprise network where I can collect logs, analyze alerts, and respond to simulated attacks.

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn to collect and analyze security logs  
- Build and configure a SIEM (e.g., Wazuh or Splunk)  
- Detect simulated attacks and write detection rules  
- Practice incident response and documentation

## 🏗️ Lab Setup
The lab will include:
- Windows VM for endpoint telemetry  
- Linux VM for attacker simulations  
- Wazuh/ELK for log collection and analysis  
- Zeek or Suricata for network monitoring  
- Firewall (pfSense)

## 🔧 Tools
- VirtualBox  
- Wazuh, Elastic Stack, Splunk Free
